<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

- The Binary Challenge is aimed at demonstrating comprehension of React app, and how to preform asynchronous testing. I built the app Cozy Cocktails using data from [this](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) API. 
- Cozy Cocktails shows a variety of cocktail recipes on page load. A user can search and filter drink recipes by ingredients, name, or alphabetically. When a user selects one of the recipes they are taken to a page where they can see all the ingredients and instructions for making it. 

## Plans for this app:

- A user will be able to login/create a profile, and see their saved drinks.
- A user will also be able to create their own drink recipe and upload it with a photo.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
