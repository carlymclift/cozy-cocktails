<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

- The Binary Challenge is aimed at demonstrating comprehension of React app, and how to preform asynchronous testing. I build the app Cozy Cocktails using data from [this]url('https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php') API. 
- Cozy Cocktails shows a variety of cocktail recipes on page load. A user can search and filter drink recipes by ingredients, name, or alphabetically. When a user selects one of the recipes they are taken to a page where they can see all the ingredients and instructions for making it. 

## Plans for this app:

- A user will be able to login/create a profile, see their saved drinks or save more.
- A user will also be able to create their own drink recipe and upload it, with a photo.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
